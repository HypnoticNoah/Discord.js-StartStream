# Discord.js-StartStream Infomration
This is a basic start stream command I made, which allows any user to advertise thier stream by using the command format and then it will forward the information into a different channel with a embed so everyone can see! In order for the command to work you have to do the following;

**[PREFIX]startstream [LINK]**
